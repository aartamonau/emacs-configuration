*              Automatic installation under Unix                     *
**********************************************************************

If you have installed the  source distribution 'xref-any' you can skip
this  section, because  you  have automatically  run the  installation
script.

Otherwise, in order to install Xrefactory on your machine just type:

    sh ./xrefsetup

This script will guide you  through the installation of Xrefactory and
will introduce its main functions.

If  you  like Xrefactory  and  you  are  super-user, you  can  install
Xrefactory  into  system  directories  by running  'sh  ./xrefinstall'
script.  This  will make  Xrefactory available for  all users  on this
machine.   However,  this  script  does  not  guide  you  through  the
Xrefactory features.

*         Manual installation for Emacs/XEmacs under Unix            *
**********************************************************************

In following text XREFDIR denotes the directory where you have untared
the  Xrefactory  distribution (it  is  not  an environment  variable).
Substitute this  directory for XREFDIR  in the following text  and put
lines:

	(setq exec-path (cons "XREFDIR" exec-path))
	(setq load-path (cons "XREFDIR/emacs" load-path))
	(load "xrefactory")

  to your ~/.emacs file.

It  is  done. It  is  highly recommended  that  you  work through  the
tutorials    in   the    files    'XREFDIR/jexercise/Index.java'   and
'XREFDIR/cexercise/index.c'.    To  start   the  tutorial   just  open
mentioned files and follow the instructions written there.

Xrefactory uses  F3-F8 functional hot-keys.  It  is highly recommended
that you keep this binding during the tutorials and initial evaluation
of Xrefactory.  Later, you can redefine key bindings either by editing
xrefactory.el file or by adding the line:

    (defvar xref-key-binding 'none)

to your  .emacs file  BEFORE loading of  "xrefactory" file.  This line
prevents Xrefactory  from binding its  functions to hot  keys allowing
you to define your own keys.


**********************************************************************
*           Manual installation for jEdit under Unix                 *
**********************************************************************

In  following  text  JEDIT  denotes  either  your  jEdit  installation
directory  (for  ex.   '/usr/share/jedit'),  or  your  personal  jEdit
configuration  directory   (~/.jedit'),  and  XREF   stands  for  your
Xrefactory installation directory.

1.) Copy XREF/jedit/Xrefactory.jar file into JEDIT/jars directory.

2.) Create directory JEDIT/jars/Xrefactory

3.) Copy XREF/xref file into JEDIT/jars/Xrefactory directory.

It  is done.  It  is hightly  recommended to  pass our  exercise files
starting  in 'XREF/jexercise/Index.java'  and 'XREF/cexercise/index.c'
files.   To  pass  exercises  just  open mentioned  files  and  follow
instructions written there.
